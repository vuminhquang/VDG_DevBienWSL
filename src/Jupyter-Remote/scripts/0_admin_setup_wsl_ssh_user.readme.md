Run the script in PowerShell with the required parameters. For example:

   ```powershell
   .\setup_wsl_ssh_user.ps1 -NewUser "new_username" -Password "your_password" -WSLDistribution "Ubuntu" -Port 22
   ```

This script will:

1. Check if the SSH client is installed.
2. Generate an SSH key pair if it does not already exist.
3. Install and configure the OpenSSH server on the WSL instance.
4. Create a new user on the specified WSL distribution.
5. Copy the public key to the new user on the WSL server.
6. Provide instructions on how to log in to the WSL server using the new user with SSH key-based authentication.

To connect remotely, ensure your WSL instance's IP address is accessible from the remote machine. You may need to adjust firewall settings or port forwarding configurations on your host machine as necessary.
